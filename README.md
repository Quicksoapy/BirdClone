## Iteration 3

### LU 4: Web Application

I have mostly worked on a 3-layer architecture, containing a data-, domain- and presentation layer.
This is not fully functional, but i'm almost there.

As planned and discussed, next up will be everything documentation-related, including but not limited to class-diagrams, UI-drawing, architecture-drawing...
All these things will also be processed into a docx-document.

## Iteration 4

### LU3: Documentation

For this iteration, i will start with writing a documentation, describing the layout of the code and UI.
